		<p><strong>What is the CVV2 and what does it look like?</strong><br />For your protection, we ask that you enter an extra 3-4 digit number called the CVV2. The CVV2 is NOT your PIN number and is not the last 3 or 4 digits of your credit card number. It is an extra ID printed on your Visa, MasterCard, Discover or American Express Card.<br />We request this code as a security measure to our customers. Requiring this information helps to ensure that the credit card is present at the time of purchase. If you cannot find this code or it is illegible, please contact your credit card issuer.</p>
		<p><strong>Visa, MasterCard and Discover:</strong><br />On the back of the card in the top-right corner of the signature box. Enter the three-digit number following the credit card number. (See below.)</p>
		<p><strong>American Express:</strong><br />On the front of the card. Enter the four-digit number on the right directly above the credit card number. (See below.)</p>
